# BlueFruit
My experimentation with the Adafruit Bluefruit Microcontroller.

The product used is the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit - Bluetooth Low Energy (Adafruit Item No. 4333)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333)

These are some minor test scripts that utilzed using [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/6.0.x/README.html)

Please feel free to copy and use as you wish.
